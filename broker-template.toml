# IMPORTANT: Running the broker with these settings will likely result in your

# broker being slashed.
#
# We strongly recommend using the Boundless CLI's `boundless prover

# Orders are preflighted (https://docs.boundless.network/provers/terminology#preflight)
# to determine the number of cycles required to prove the order. Based on this
# cycle count, and the current price of the order, the broker computes the
# current price per mega-cycle being offered for the order. This value is compared to the
# `min_mcycle_price` to determine if the order should be locked.
#
# This price is also used for secondary fulfillment (lock-expired orders), where it is
# converted to ZKC via the price oracle and discounted by the expected probability of
# winning the proof race.

# Price Oracle Configuration
# =============================================================================
# The price oracle is used to convert between ETH, ZKC and USD prices dynamically.
# By default, it uses Chainlink (on-chain) and CoinGecko (off-chain) sources.
#
# You can configure each trading pair independently to use either:
# - "auto": Fetch prices dynamically from configured sources (default)
# - A static value: e.g., "2500.00" for ETH/USD or "1.00" for ZKC/USD

[price_oracle]
# ETH/USD price configuration
# Default: "auto" (fetches dynamically from Chainlink + CoinGecko)
# Example static value: eth_usd = "2500.00"
eth_usd = "auto"

# ZKC/USD price configuration
# Default: "auto" (fetches dynamically from Chainlink + CoinGecko)
# Example static value: zkc_usd = "1.00"
zkc_usd = "auto"

# Advanced options (usually don't need to be changed)
# refresh_interval_secs = 60          # How often to refresh cached prices (default: 60)
# timeout_secs = 10                   # HTTP/RPC timeout for price fetching (default: 10)
# aggregation_mode = "median"         # How to combine sources: "priority", "median", or "average" (default: "median")
# min_sources = 1                     # Minimum successful sources required (default: 1)
# max_secs_without_price_update = 43200  # Max seconds without a price update before logging error; 0 to disable (default: 43200 / 12h)

# On-chain price sources
# [price_oracle.onchain.chainlink]
# enabled = true                      # Use Chainlink price feeds (default: true)

# Off-chain price sources
