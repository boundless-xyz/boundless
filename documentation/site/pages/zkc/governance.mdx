# Governance

:::note[Contract Deployments]
The Boundless governance contracts have been deployed by Aragon: [Boundless DAO](https://app.aragon.org/dao/ethereum-mainnet/boundless.dao.eth).
:::

### Voting Power & Staking

To be eligible to vote in the Boundless DAO, token holders must stake $ZKC; voting power is relative to the percentage of total staked $ZKC i.e. an address that stakes 1% of the total staked $ZKC will possess 1% of the total voting power.

### What does governance control?

With the launch of ZKC, the DAO is going through a set of test proposals to ensure that each governance process is fully functional. Once these are successful, the DAO will be given full ownership of the protocol.

Initially, governance will control five main processes:

- *Market upgrades*: Upgrades to the logic of the Boundless market and adjacent onchain infrastructure such as verifier contracts.
- *Token upgrades*: Upgrades to core token variables such as emission schedules and permissions to distribute POVW rewards
- *Governance upgrades*: Upgrades to the governance processes themselves.
- *Grants*: Proposals for $ZKC token grants to community members, ecosystem partners and any other parties deemed to be contributing to the success of Boundless.
- *Emergency upgrades*: Upgrades to address time sensitive issues that impact the safety of funds or the safety of protocols using Boundless.

You can find more details on how the DAO is structured at Aragonâ€™s portal for [Boundless Governance](#TODO).
