# Bridging $ZKC

$ZKC is deployed on Ethereum mainnet. To use $ZKC in the Boundless market on Base mainnet, $ZKC must be bridged from mainnet to Base mainnet.

## Bridging using Base's Native Bridges

To bridge $ZKC from Ethereum mainnet to Base mainnet, see the [Base documentation for bridging assets to Base](https://docs.base.org/base-chain/network-information/bridges-mainnet).

## Manual Bridging using `cast`

If the native bridges do not include $ZKC yet (see this [open PR](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1198)), there is the option to manually bridge using `cast`. This is not ideal, and should only be used as a temporary measure until $ZKC is available on Superbridge and other supported bridges.

To start, make sure to have `cast` installed. This will require [installing Foundry](https://getfoundry.sh/introduction/installation/). Next, export the `PRIVATE_KEY` for the address holding the $ZKC tokens:

```bash
export PRIVATE_KEY=0x1234...5678
```

Set the `AMOUNT` and `ETH_MAINNET_RPC_URL` environment variables:

```bash
export AMOUNT=10000000000000000000 # 10 ZKC
ETH_MAINNET_RPC_URL="https://"
```

with the amount to be bridged, and a valid RPC URL for Ethereum mainnet respectively.

Next, approve the Base bridge to spend $AMOUNT tokens:

```bash
cast send 0x000006c2A22ff4A44ff1f5d0F2ed65F781F55555 \
  "approve(address,uint256)" \
  0x3154Cf16ccdb4C6d922629664174b904d80F2C35 \
  $AMOUNT \
  --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY \
  --rpc-url $ETH_MAINNET_RPC_URL
```

Finally, bridge $AMOUNT tokens:

```bash
cast send 0x3154Cf16ccdb4C6d922629664174b904d80F2C35 \
  "bridgeERC20(address,address,uint256,uint32,bytes)" \
  0x000006c2A22ff4A44ff1f5d0F2ed65F781F55555 \
  0xAA61bB7777bD01B684347961918f1E07fBbCe7CF \
  $AMOUNT \
  300000 \
  0x \
  --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY \
  --rpc-url $ETH_MAINNET_RPC_URL
```
