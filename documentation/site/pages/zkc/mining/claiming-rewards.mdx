# Claiming Rewards

## Mining Rewards

:::tip
Claiming mining rewards requires *both* a valid archive node RPC endpoint and a Beacon Chain RPC endpoint. 

In our testing, the Alchemy free RPC plan in combination with the public beacon chain API URL (`https://ethereum-beacon-api.publicnode.com/`) works for claiming rewards. Quicknode works for the beacon chain endpoint, but both free and paid Quicknode RPC endpoints are not recommended for `claim` as it commonly errors with request rate limits.

After the reward epoch has finalized, mining rewards can be claimed with:

```bash
boundless povw claim --reward-address ${REWARD_ADDRESS} --beacon-api-url${BEACON_CHAIN_RPC_ENDPOINT} --rpc-url ${RPC_URL} --private-key ${PRIVATE_KEY}
```

This process is permissionless and DOES NOT require the private key for the address eligible for the rewards. The only requirement is that the `PRIVATE_KEY` has enough funds to cover gas costs on Ethereum mainnet.

## Staking Rewards

After the reward epoch has finalized, staking rewards can be claimed with:

```bash
boundless zkc claim-rewards --rpc-url <RPC_URL> --private-key <PRIVATE_KEY>
```

where `PRIVATE_KEY` is the private key of the address that has the [reward power](/zkc/mining/wallet-setup#stakes-zkc-and-receives-reward-power) i.e. the rewards address if the delegation best practice is followed. 

## Checking Details of Current Reward Epoch

If the reward epoch has not been finalized yet, provers can check details of the the current epoch:

```bash
boundless zkc get-current-epoch
```

This will return the epoch number; this epoch number can be passed into the following command to get the end time for the current epoch:

```bash
boundless zkc get-epoch-end-time <EPOCH_NUMBER>
```
