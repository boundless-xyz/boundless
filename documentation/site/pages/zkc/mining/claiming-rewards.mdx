# Claiming Rewards

## Via the CLI

:::tip
Claiming mining rewards requires *both* a valid archive node RPC endpoint and a Beacon Chain RPC endpoint. 

In our testing, the Alchemy free RPC plan in combination with the public beacon chain API URL (`https://ethereum-beacon-api.publicnode.com/`) works for claiming rewards. Quicknode works for the beacon chain endpoint, but both free and paid Quicknode RPC endpoints are not recommended for `claim` as it commonly errors with request rate limits.

After the reward epoch has finalized, rewards can be claimed with:

```bash
boundless povw claim --reward-address ${REWARD_ADDRESS} --beacon-api-url${BEACON_CHAIN_RPC_ENDPOINT} --rpc-url ${RPC_URL}
```

## Checking Details of Current Reward Epoch

If the reward epoch has not been finalized yet, provers can check details of the the current epoch:

```bash
boundless zkc get-current-epoch
```

This will return the epoch number; this epoch number can be passed into the following command to get the end time for the current epoch:

```bash
boundless zkc get-epoch-end-time <EPOCH_NUMBER>
```
