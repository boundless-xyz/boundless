# What is "Proof of Verifiable Work"?

Proof of Verifiable Work (PoVW), a novel invention within Boundless, is a permissionless incentive mechanism which enables provers to be rewarded in $ZKC in exchange for their proving work on the Boundless marketplace or elsewhere. Provers generating unique zero-knowledge proofs are rewarded with $ZKC. *This page explains the process of claiming PoVW $ZKC rewards.*

:::note[Note]
This page introduces the concepts necessary to understand Proof of Verifiable Work (PoVW) and effectively claim rewards. For more information on PoVW, refer to section 2.3.1 of the [Boundless whitepaper](https://read.boundless.network/) and the “[Introducing ZK Coin](https://boundless.network/blog/introducing-zk-coin)” blog post.

## Prerequisites

:::note[Requirements]
Provers will require NVIDIA GPUs and Ubuntu 24.04. For a full list of requirements, please see [Requirements](/provers/quick-start#requirements).
:::

::::steps

#### Install the latest release

PoVW was added to RISC Zero’s zkVM ([R0VM](https://github.com/risc0/risc0)) in version 3.0.1. To enable PoVW within Bento, requires release [v0.14.0](https://github.com/boundless-xyz/boundless/releases/tag/v0.14.0) and above.

To install the latest release, and use the helpful setup script, provers can follow the instructions on the [Quick Start](/provers/quick-start) before continuing with the next step.

#### Make sure to have the Boundless CLI installed

Provers use the Boundless CLI to stake $ZKC, prepare work log updates, and submit them onchain. To install the Boundless CLI (and build with CUDA support), run:

```bash
cargo install --locked --git https://github.com/boundless-xyz/boundless boundless-cli --branch release-1.0 --bin boundless -F cuda
```

#### Install the latest version of Foundry

Some commands in this tutorial use [cast](https://getfoundry.sh/cast/overview) from the [Foundry toolkit](https://getfoundry.sh/). This is not necessary, but it will make some CLI commands more straightforward.

#### Install the latest version of Rust

Follow the instructions [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

#### Install the latest version of rzup

Follow the instructions [here](https://dev.risczero.com/api/zkvm/install#installation-for-x86-64-linux-and-arm64-macos).

#### Install `risc0-groth16` using `rzup`

Run the following:

```bash
rzup install risc0-groth16
```

#### Install all the necessary NVIDIA drivers

```bash
apt install nvidia-cuda-toolkit build-essential libssl-dev cuda-toolkit-13-0 nvidia-open
```

#### Update $PATH and export the necessary CUDA flags

```bash
export PATH=/usr/local/cuda/bin:$PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export NVCC_APPEND_FLAGS="--generate-code arch=compute_75,code=sm_75 --generate-code arch=compute_86,code=sm_86 --generate-code arch=compute_89,code=sm_89 --generate-code arch=compute_90,code=sm_90 --generate-code arch=compute_120,code=sm_120"
```

#### Stop Bento Safely

To enable PoVW in Bento, first make sure to stop Bento safely. This ensures that any in-progress proving jobs are completed before terminating the proving process. If Bento is backing the Broker, please carry out *Step 1* from [Safe Upgrade Steps](/provers/broker#safe-upgrade-steps) and then return to this page.

If Bento is running without the Broker, Bento can be safely stopped with:

```bash
just bento down
```

#### Specify the Log ID Address

:::note[PoVW Specific Terminology]
It is recommended to read the [Terminology](/zkc/povw/claiming-rewards#terminology) section before running the commands listed below.
:::

:::tip[Tip]
Provers can use their Log ID as their $ZKC staking address; for simplicity, the following tutorial uses the Log ID to stake $ZKC as well. In practice, provers may decide to use a separate wallet to stake $ZKC. For more information, see [Key Separation](#key-separation).
:::

Before starting Bento again, provers need to enable the PoVW feature. This requires a valid Ethereum address set to the `POVW_LOG_ID` environment variable. It is recommended to set this directly with your compose.yml file:

```yml
x-base-environment: &base-environment
    DATABASE_URL: postgresql://${POSTGRES_USER:-worker}:${POSTGRES_PASSWORD:-password}@${POSTGRES_HOST:-postgres}:${POSTGRES_PORT:-5432}/${POSTGRES_DB:-taskdb}
  REDIS_URL: redis://${REDIS_HOST:-redis}:6379
  S3_URL: http://${MINIO_HOST:-minio}:9000
  S3_BUCKET: ${MINIO_BUCKET:-workflow}
  S3_ACCESS_KEY: ${MINIO_ROOT_USER:-admin}
  S3_SECRET_KEY: ${MINIO_ROOT_PASS:-password}
  RUST_LOG: ${RUST_LOG:-info}
  RISC0_HOME: /usr/local/risc0
  RUST_BACKTRACE: 1
  POVW_LOG_ID: "0x1234...5678" // [!code hl] [!code focus]
```

Provers will need the private key for this address when using the PoVW CLI to prepare and submit valid work to the PoVW contracts.  Please see [Provers submit a Work Log Update](/zkc/povw/claiming-rewards#provers-submit-a-work-log-update-with-submit) for more information.

#### Export the PRIVATE_KEY and RPC_URL environment variables

Export the private key for the `POVW_LOG_ID`, and a valid RPC endpoint URL for Ethereum mainnet:

```bash
export PRIVATE_KEY=[PRIVATE_KEY]
export RPC_URL=[RPC_URL]
```

#### Start Bento

Once enabled, Bento can be run as normal with:

```bash
just bento
```

Or if running the broker as well:

```bash
just broker
```

will start both the broker and Bento.
