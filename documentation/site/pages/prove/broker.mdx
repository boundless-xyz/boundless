# Broker Operation & Configuration

The Broker is an optional service that runs within the [Bento](/prove/bento) docker compose stack. It is responsible for market interactions including bidding on jobs, locking them, issuing job requests to the Bento proving cluster, and submitting proof fulfillments on-chain.

## Broker Configuration

Broker configuration is primarily managed through the `broker.toml` file in the Boundless directory. This file is mounted into the Broker container and it is used to configure the Broker daemon. This allows for dynamic configuration of the Broker without needing to restart the daemon as in most cases variables are refreshed. If you have changed a `broker.toml` configuration, and it does not appear to take effect you can restart the Broker service manually to apply the changes.

### Deposit / Balance

The Boundless market works via an escrow system. Brokers must first deposit some ETH (or SepETH) into the market contract to fund their account. These funds cover staking during lock-in. It is recommend that a broker keep a balance on the market >= `max_stake` (configured via broker.toml).

### Deposit to the Market

```sh [Terminal]
export RPC_URL=<TARGET_CHAIN_RPC_URL>
export PRIVATE_KEY=<BROKER_PRIVATE_KEY>
export BOUNDLESS_MARKET_ADDRESS=<BOUNDLESS_MARKET_ADDR>

# Example: 'deposit 0.5'
RUST_LOG=info cargo run --bin cli -- deposit <ETH_TO_DEPOSIT>
```

### Check Current Balance

```sh [Terminal]
export RPC_URL=<TARGET_CHAIN_RPC_URL>
export PRIVATE_KEY=<BROKER_PRIVATE_KEY>
export BOUNDLESS_MARKET_ADDRESS=<BOUNDLESS_MARKET_ADDR>

RUST_LOG=info cargo run --bin cli -- balance [wallet_address]
```

You can omit the `PRIVATE_KEY` environment variable here and specify your `wallet_address` as a optional parameter to the `balance` command, i.e. `balance 0x000....`

### Settings in Broker.toml

:::warning[Warning]
Quotation marks matter in TOML so please pay particular attention to the quotation marks for config values.
:::

`broker.toml` contains the following settings for the market:

| setting                  | initial value | description                                                                                                    |
| ------------------------ | ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| mcycle\_price            | `".001"`      | The price (in native token of target market) of proving 1M cycles.                                             |
| assumption\_price        | `"0.1"`       | Currently unused.                                                                                              |
| peak\_prove\_khz         | `500`         | This should correspond to the maximum number of cycles per second (in kHz) your proving backend can operate.   |
| min\_deadline            | `150`         | This is a minimum number of blocks before the requested job expiration that Broker will attempt to lock a job. |
| lookback\_blocks         | `100`         | This is used on Broker initialization, and sets the number of blocks to look back for candidate proofs.        |
| max\_stake               | `"0.5"`       | The maximum amount used to lock in a job for any single order.                                                 |
| skip\_preflight\_ids     | `[]`          | A list of `imageID`s that the Broker should skip preflight checks in format `["0xID1","0xID2"]`.               |

| allow\_client\_addresses | `[]`          | When defined, this acts as a firewall to limit proving only to specific client addresses.                           |
| lockin\_priority\_gas    | `100`         | Additional gas to add to the base price when locking in stake on a contract to increase priority.              |

## Broker Operation

### Make sure Bento is running

:::warning[Warning]
A Broker needs a [Bento](/prove/bento) instance to operate. Please follow the [quick start](/prove/quick-start) guide to get Bento up and running. 
:::

To check Bento is running correctly, you can send a sample proof workload:

```sh [Terminal]
RUST_LOG=info cargo run --bin bento_cli -- -c 32
```

```txt [Terminal]
2024-10-23T14:37:37.364844Z  INFO bento_cli: image_id: a0dfc25e54ebde808e4fd8c34b6549bbb91b4928edeea90ceb7d1d8e7e9096c7 | input_id: eccc8f06-488a-426c-ae3d-e5acada9ae22

### Funding Your Broker on the Proving Market

:::warning[Warning]
For the current Sepolia testnet phase, we recommend funding your broker account around 1-2 Sepolia ETH. We are striving to make gas costs for market interactions in future significantly less.
:::

For the broker to interact with a [market contract](/deployments), it needs to have an associated account with a sufficient $ETH balance to pay for gas fees.

The following process will guide you through setting up a new wallet and funding it with testnet ETH:

::::steps

##### Set the environment variables `PRIVATE_KEY`, `SET_VERIFIER_ADDR`,`BOUNDLESS_MARKET_ADDR` in `.env-compose`

```sh [Terminal]
# Prover node configs
....
PRIVATE_KEY=0xYOUR_TEST_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY_HERE
....
BOUNDLESS_MARKET_ADDR=0x261D8c5e9742e6f7f1076Fa1F560894524e19cad # This is the address of the market contract on the target chain.
....
RPC_URL="https://rpc.sepolia.org" # This is the RPC URL of the target chain.
....
```

##### Source the `.env-compose` file

```sh [Terminal]
source .env-compose
```

##### The Broker account needs funds deposited on the Boundless market contract to cover lock-in stake on requests. Run the following command to deposit an initial amount of ETH into the market contract:

```sh 
# Set amount in ETH denominated units
# 0.5 Sepolia ETH should be OK for basic testing
# BOUNDLESS_DEPOSIT=0.5

RUST_LOG=info,boundless_market=debug cargo run --bin cli --  deposit ${BOUNDLESS_DEPOSIT:?}
```

```txt [Terminal]

### Running the Broker service

:::warning[Warning]
Before running the Broker, make sure you have connected to a running instance of Bento.
:::

```sh [Terminal]
docker compose --profile broker --env-file ./.env-compose up --build
```

## Broker Optimization

### Increasing Lock-in Rate

Once your broker is running, there are a few methods to optimize the lock-in rate. These methods are aimed at making your broker service more competitive in the market through different means:

1. Decreasing the `mcycle_price` would tune your Broker to bid at lower prices for proofs.
2. Increasing `lockin_priority_gas` expedites your market operations by consuming more gas which could help outrun other bidders.
3. Adding known a `imageID` to `skip_preflight_ids` would reduce the delay of preflight/execution on a binary. This would allow you to beat other Brokers by submitting bids quicker.

### Tuning Service Settings

The `[prover]` settings in `broker.toml` are used to configure the prover service and significantly impact the operation of the service. The most important configuration variable to monitor and iteratively tune is `txn_timeout`. This is the number of seconds to wait for a transaction to be confirmed before timing out. Therefore, if you see timeouts in your logs, `txn_timeout` can be increased to wait longer for transaction confirmations on-chain.


## Debugging

### Orders Stuck in 'Lockin' or `submit_merkle` Confirmation Timeouts

You may notice on the [indexer](https://indexer.beboundless.xyz) that the broker has a high number of orders locked-in, but the fulfillment rate is low or even zero. This could be due to transaction confirmation timeouts. A good place to start would be to increase the `txn_timeout` in the `broker.toml` file iteratively, and see how that affects the broker's fulfillment rate.

If you need a manual way to restart orders that are "stuck", please follow:

::::steps

##### First, you'll need to manually connect to the SQLite database for the broker. This can be done inside the broker container via `sqlite3 /db/broker.db` or by mounting the `broker-data` Docker volume

##### Next, you'll need to find the batch that contains the order:

```sql [Terminal]
SELECT id FROM batches WHERE data->>'orders' LIKE '%"TARGET_ORDER_ID"%';
-- Example: SELECT id FROM batches WHERE data->>'orders' LIKE '%"0x466acfc0f27bba9fbb7a8508f576527e81e83bd00000caa"%';
```

##### Finally, you can trigger a rerun of the submitter task:

```sql [Terminal]
UPDATE batches SET data = json_set(data, '$.status', 'Complete') WHERE id = YOUR_BATCH_ID_FROM_STEP_2;
-- Example: UPDATE batches SET data = json_set(data, '$.status', 'Complete') WHERE id = 1;
```
