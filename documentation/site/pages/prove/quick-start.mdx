# Quick Start

:::note
To become a prover on Boundless requires significant hardware, software setup and a good maintenance pipeline to avoid downtime. Before continuing, make sure you are familiar with the prover [requirements](/prove/requirements).
:::

Bento is a Docker compose stack containing all the services to run a proving cluster for the Boundless Market.

You'll need the following dependencies:

* [Docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose)
* [Docker Nvidia Support](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/index.html) 

To get started, first clone the Boundless monorepo on your proving machine:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/boundless-xyz/boundless
```

## Host Setup

Ubuntu is currently the only supported Operating system. Other operating systems _should_ work, but driver support (host Nvidia drivers matching container drivers etc.), compile dependencies, and testing fall to the user to complete.

For a quick set up of Boundless host dependencies on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, please run:

```sh
cd boundless
chmod +x scripts/setup.sh && ./scripts/setup.sh
```

## Configuration

The `compose.yml` file defines all the services within the Bento. Here you can configure the number of GPU's via adding new `gpu_agent<I>` and changing the `device_ids` to map to specific physical GPUs (if on a single host, multi-GPU config).

Under the `exec_agent` service you can configure the segment size with the `--segment-po2` flag. Bigger segments are preferable for performance but do impact the proving systems conjectured security bits slightly. In order to pick the right segment po2 for your GPU VRAM see [reports.risczero.com](https://reports.risczero.com) for details.

Services can be run on other hosts, as long as the IP addresses for things link PostgreSQL / Redis / MinIO are updated on the remote host. **See the `.env-compose` \*\_HOST configuration options here to adjust them.**

## Running Bento

To build and spin up a Bento cluster locally using Docker:

```sh
docker compose --env-file ./.env-compose up --build
```

Optionally you can use the startup script included in this repo:

```sh 
scripts/boundless_service.sh start
```

To stop the Boundless service:

```sh 
scripts/boundless_service.sh stop
```

## Sending a Sample Proof to the Cluster

Using a simple test vector for testing different cycle counts (via the -c flag):

```sh 
RUST_LOG=info cargo run --bin bento_cli -- -c 32
```

Or with a existing ELF / input file:

```sh 
RUST_LOG=info cargo run --bin bento_cli -- -f ./crates/bento-client/method_name -i /tmp/input.bin
```
