# Quick Start

## Dependencies

:::tip[Tip]
This stage can be skipped if you already have docker and docker-nvidia installed.
:::

To run a Boundless prover, you'll need the following dependencies:

* [Docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose)
* [Docker Nvidia Support](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/index.html) 

For a quick set up of Boundless dependencies on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (see [Operating System Requirements](/prove/requirements#operating-system)), please run:

```sh
/scripts/setup.sh
```

## Setup

### Clone the Boundless repo

To get started, first clone the Boundless monorepo on your proving machine, and change directory locally:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/boundless-xyz/boundless
cd boundless
```

### Running Bento + Broker

The recommended place to start is the `scripts/boundless_service.sh` script. This script which will run everything you need to start proving on Boundless:

```sh [Terminal]
Usage: scripts/boundless_service.sh [command] [options]

Commands:
  start   Start Docker Compose services
  stop    Stop and remove Docker Compose services

Options:
  -e, --env-file FILE    Specify a custom environment file (default: ./.env-compose)
  -h, --help             Display this help message

Examples:
  scripts/boundless_service.sh start
  scripts/boundless_service.sh start --env-file ./.env.production
  scripts/boundless_service.sh stop
  scripts/boundless_service.sh stop --env-file ./.env.production

```

## Configuration

The `compose.yml` file defines all services within Bento. The Boundless repo includes a starter `compose.yml` which you can see [here](https://github.com/boundless-xyz/boundless/blob/main/compose.yml). For Broker configuration options, please see [Broker.toml](/prove/broker#settings-in-brokertoml).

### Multi GPU

It is here that you can configure the number of GPU's via adding new `gpu_agent<I>` and changing the `device_ids` to map to specific physical GPUs (if on a single host, multi-GPU config).

### Multi Host

Services can be run on other hosts, as long as the IP addresses for things link PostgreSQL / Redis / MinIO are updated on the remote host. See the `.env-compose` HOST configuration options [here](https://github.com/boundless-xyz/boundless/blob/main/.env-compose) to adjust them.

### Segment Size

Under the `exec_agent` service you can configure the segment size with the `--segment-po2` flag. Bigger segments are preferable for performance but do impact the proving systems conjectured security bits slightly. In order to pick the right segment po2 for your GPU VRAM see [reports.risczero.com](https://reports.risczero.com) for details.


## Sending a Test Proof to Bento

Once everything is up, you can send a test proof to Bento to see if everything works. There are two options for test proofs:

1. The Bento CLI allows for a simple test vector with a specified cycle count via the `-c` flag:

```sh [Terminal]
RUST_LOG=info cargo run --bin bento_cli -- -c 32
```

2. The Bento CLI also accepts existing ELF / input files for [Boundless programs](/build/build-a-program):

```sh [Terminal]
RUST_LOG=info cargo run --bin bento_cli -- -f ./crates/bento-client/method_name -i /tmp/input.bin
```
