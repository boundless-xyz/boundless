## Overview of Proving in the Boundless Market

The Boundless Market enables anyone with the right infrastructure and expertise to become a prover. Provers play a critical role in the ecosystem by evaluating proof requests, participating in auctions, and generating proofs that fulfill these requests.

As a prover, your responsibilities include:

* **Evaluating Proof Requests**: Assessing the feasibility and cost of fulfilling a request based on factors like program complexity, cycle count, stake requirements, and timeout length.
* **Participating in Auctions**: Competing in reverse Dutch auctions to win proof-generating opportunities. The auction mechanism ensures that provers who bid first get the best prices for requestors.
* **Generating Proofs**: Using high-performance hardware (e.g. GPUs) to generate proofs efficiently and deliver them before the request timeout.


## Rewards for Proving

Provers are rewarded through the auction mechanism where requestors set price ranges. The first prover to lock a request secures the best price, determined by market dynamics and efficiency. Additionally, contributing to market efficiency can enhance your rewards by lowering costs and improving competition.

## Who Should Be a Prover?
Becoming a prover is ideal for individuals or organizations with:

* Expertise in running high-performance infrastructure.
* Spare GPU capacity that can be utilized for proof generation.
* An understanding of cryptographic protocols and decentralized systems.
* Proving requires significant computational resources, especially for parallelized GPU proving. Provers must balance hardware investment, operational costs, and the competitive nature of auctions to succeed.

## Getting Started as a Prover
While provers can build their own infrastructure from scratch, Boundless provides a recommended [proving stack](/prove/proving-stack). To get started, please see the Boundless Prover [Quick Start](/prove/quick-start).
