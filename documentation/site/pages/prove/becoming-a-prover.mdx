# Becoming a Prover

:::warning[Be warned!] 
Running a *competitive* prover requires expensive hardware and extensive expertise. We predict that multiple top-of-the-line GPUs (e.g., NVIDIA RTX 4090s) will be necessary to run a competitive prover. This level of investment and technical know-how may be out of reach for most consumer-grade setups. 

For more details on the hardware and technical requirements, please see the [Requirements](/prove/requirements) section.

## Who Should Be a Prover?
Becoming a prover is ideal for individuals or organizations with:

* Expertise in running high-performance infrastructure.
* Spare GPU capacity that can be utilized for proof generation.
* An understanding of cryptographic protocols and decentralized systems.
* Proving requires significant computational resources, especially for parallelized GPU proving. Provers must balance hardware investment, operational costs, and the competitive nature of auctions to succeed.

## Overview of Proving in the Boundless Market

The Boundless Market enables anyone with the right infrastructure and expertise to become a prover. Provers play a critical role in the ecosystem by evaluating proof requests, participating in auctions, and generating proofs that fulfill these requests.

As a prover, your responsibilities include:

* **Evaluating Proof Requests**: Assessing the feasibility and cost of fulfilling a request based on factors like program complexity, cycle count, stake requirements, and timeout length.
* **Participating in Auctions**: Competing in reverse Dutch auctions to win proof-generating opportunities. The auction mechanism ensures that provers who bid first get the best prices for requestors.
* **Generating Proofs**: Using high-performance hardware (e.g. GPUs) to generate proofs efficiently and deliver them before the request timeout.


### Rewards for Proving

Provers are rewarded through the auction mechanism where requestors set the [pricing parameters](/build/pricing-a-request). The first prover to lock a request secures the best price, determined by market dynamics and efficiency. To understand how a request is priced, take a look at the [pricing calculator](/build/pricing-a-request#-pricing-calculator).



## Getting Started as a Prover
While provers can build their own infrastructure from scratch, Boundless provides a recommended [proving stack](/prove/proving-stack). To get started, please see the [quick start](/prove/quick-start) guide.
