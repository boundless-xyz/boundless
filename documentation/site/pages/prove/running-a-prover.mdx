# Running a Prover

At the core of the Boundless proving software is *Bento*, which fundamentally builds upon the [RISC Zero zkVM](https://dev.risczero.com/api/zkvm/). The Boundless team shipped *Bento* after 2+ years of operating a highly parallelized and highly performant remote proving cluster, known as [Bonsai](https://dev.risczero.com/api/generating-proofs/remote-proving). Bento encapsulates this practical experience and learnings into a stack built for the Boundless market. Bento scales from single GPU machines to large clusters which makes it ideal for provers in the Boundless protocol.

### Why Bento?

*Bento* is a highly configurable proving cluster for Boundless provers and features:

- [multi GPU support]().
- support for proofs of any size.
- safe cache/storage for all proof data.
- a robust retry system.
- an API for proof management.

## [Bento](/prove/bento)

Bento is a semi multi-tenant proving cluster for the [RISC0 zkVM](https://dev.risczero.com/api/zkvm/). Concretely, Bento is a Docker compose stack which contains all the services needed to run a Bento cluster.

The [Prover Quick Start](/prove/quick-start) has information about getting started with Bento, a recommended initial configuration and how to run basic sample proof workloads. For a deeper dive into Bento's technical design, components and configuration, please see [Bento](/prove/bento). 

## [Broker](/prove/broker)

:::warning
For all provers, a balance is *necessary* to be able to cover stake upon proof request lock-in, otherwise the prover will not be able to participate in the market. The Broker service provides a straightforward way to [deposit funds](/prove/broker#deposit-to-the-market) to the market.
:::

The Broker is an important service that runs within the Bento docker compose stack. It is responsible for market interactions (see steps **2b.** and **4a.** in *Figure 1*) including bidding on jobs, locking them, issuing job requests to the Bento proving cluster, and submitting proof fulfillments on-chain. Broker configuration is primarily managed through the [`broker.toml`]() file in the Boundless directory.

## How are Bento and the Broker related?

:::note
A wise man once said "Bento can thrive without a broker, but a broker can not survive without Bento".

Parker, 2k24
:::

Bento is responsible for:

* the API for managing proof requests.
* queuing and scheduling proof requests.
* executing guest programs.
* running proving using the RISC Zero zkVM.
* aggregating proofs into the right format for the Boundless Market.

Bento is **not** responsible for interaction with the Boundless market.

The recommended service for market interaction for provers is the [Broker](/prove/) service. The Broker is responsible for both interacting with the Boundless Market i.e. bidding and locking-in proof jobs *and* sending job requests to the Bento proving cluster.
