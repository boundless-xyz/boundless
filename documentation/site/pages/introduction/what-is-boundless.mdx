# What Is Boundless?

Boundless is the first universal ZK protocol that transforms how developers build with zero-knowledge proofs across any chain. Boundless has two core components:

- [**Core Services**](#core-services): Best-in-class ZK infrastructure to handle proof generation, aggregation, and settlement on any chain. Boundless services take care of all the complexity, letting you focus on building.
- [**Extensions**](#extensions): Purpose-built tools that plug ZK directly into your stack. Use familiar languages and existing code while harnessing the full power of ZK.

With Boundless, developers can create new applications or enhance existing ones with unlimited compute. Keep your preferred languages and tools, deploy to any chain, and scale automatically, all while Boundless handles the underlying infrastructure.

## Core Services

Core Services are the engine powering the most performant, reliable and cost-efficient proof delivery to your protocol on-chain. Boundless abstracts away the complexities of launching and maintaining a ZK application, providing a seamless experience while ensuring access to top-tier ZK infrastructure. These services include:

### Proving

Proof any program through a decentralized proof marketplace. Competitive proving services ensure reliable delivery, liveness, and best-in-class pricing.

### Aggregation

Reduce on-chain verification costs by up to 95% through proof aggregation. Multiple proofs are combined before settlement, dramatically lowering costs while maintaining security.

### Settlement

Developing, deploying, and maintaining market and verifier contracts across multiple chains is a heavy burden for developers. Boundless eliminates this by maintaining these contracts for you. With an ever-expanding list of supported chains, Boundless ensures your application is ready to settle proofs wherever you build.

## Extensions

Boundless Extensions are purpose-built tools that plug ZK capabilities directly into your existing stack. These integration tools accelerate development and expand functionality, whether you're building rollups, enhancing existing applications, or exploring new possibilities. Extensions are organized by common use cases:

- [**For Rollups**](/introduction/extensions#for-rollups): Extensions that make deploying a rollup easier within Boundless, such as a full rollup stack, integrations for existing rollup ecosystems and alt-DA support.
- [**For EVM Developers**](/introduction/extensions#for-evm-developers): Make EVM application development easier with Solidity execution in the zkVM and additional abstractions through 3rd parties.
