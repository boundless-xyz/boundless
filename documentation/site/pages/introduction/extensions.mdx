## For EVM Developers

### [Steel](https://risczero.com/steel)

Steel is a production-ready smart contract execution prover designed to bring boundless runtime to all EVM apps. Using execution proofs, Steel enables EVM apps to run off-chain, while preserving on-chain security. With Steel, you can prove correct smart contract execution without re-execution, allowing blockchain developers unbounded computation over on-chain data.
