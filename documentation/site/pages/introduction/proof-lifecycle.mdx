# Proof Lifecycle

## Lifecycle of a Proof

![Proof Lifecycle](/boundless_market_diagram.png)

::::steps

### Program Initialization

A program is created with the RISC0 zkVM, requiring a proof to validate its content.

### Request Submission

A request is sent to the market, including all necessary information for evaluating and generating the proof.

### <span class="text-[var(--vocs-color\_textAccent)]">\*</span> Prover Bidding

Provers analyze the request and propose a price they are willing to accept to generate the proof.

### <span class="text-[var(--vocs-color\_textAccent)]">\*</span> Agreement and Staking

Once a prover's bid is accepted, the transaction is finalized. Both parties stake funds to guarantee payment and ensure the prover's commitment to deliver the proof.

### <span class="text-[var(--vocs-color\_textAccent)]">\*</span> Proof Generation

The prover generates the requested proof.

### <span class="text-[var(--vocs-color\_textAccent)]">\*</span> Proof Settlement

The market verifies the proof. Upon successful verification, funds are released to the prover.

### Proof Utilization

The application retrieves the proof and integrates it seamlessly.

## Who's Involved in Boundless?

### Requestors

Boundless users who request proofs from the marketplace are known as requestors.
To request a proof, you need a relevant zkVM guest program which compiles successfully.
You will also need to stake the maximum price you are willing to pay for a proof generation.
You do not need special hardware to request proofs.
Applications, which use Boundless programmatically for proof generation, have a requestor service. This service is async with an overall time dependent on the time it takes for the request to be sent, locked in, and fulfilled.
Request parameter overview (at a high level)
Appnet focus is entirely on requestors!
This is you as a developer.

### Provers

Boundless users who supply the marketplace with proof generation are known as provers.
To prove on Boundless, this requires special hardware. The zkVM focuses on GPU acceleration and therefore, provers require NVIDIA graphics cards for CUDA acceleration.
Provers will check the marketplace contract for a list of requests, and based on price for proving and proof generation time, decide to take on a proof request. This is known as locking in an order.
They will then run the zkVM software to generate a proof, at which point this proof will be sent back onchain for the requestor to access.

### zkVM

The Boundless stack is currently only built for RISC Zero's zkVM. The zkVM executes and proves a Rust program to produce a STARK/SNARK proof.
zkVM docs are detailed and explain a lot.

## Where Does Boundless Fit into Your App? \[Mix in pieces from here above]

- Boundless is the best way to generate proofs for your application.
- What are the main properties of proofs that make them so special?
  - Verifying a proof gives you the assurance that a certain program was run correctly, and the outputs are correct, without having to run the entire program yourself.
  - Proof verification time is constant with respect to program length, effectively compressing your program in a trustless manner.
- So, what does a proof do for your application?
  - Compressing your program into one neat and verifiable package.
  - This allows you to offload execution from your application (onchain to offchain).
  - Allow for the same trust assumptions as onchain (magic of ZK).
  - Provide a portable way to verify your program both offchain and onchain.
- That's great, show me the good stuff:
  - Workflow diagram of a standard onchain application (think excalidraw) utilising a ZK proof to offload execution to the prover.
  - High level discussion of tradeoffs for verifiable compute on Boundless: latency, price, speed etc.
