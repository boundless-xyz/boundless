# Steel - Boundless runtime for EVM apps

## Introducing Steel, a production-ready smart contract execution prover

Steel is a production-ready smart contract execution prover designed to bring boundless runtime to all EVM apps. Using execution proofs, Steel enables EVM apps to run offchain, while preserving onchain security. With Steel, you can prove correct smart contract execution without re-execution, allowing blockchain developers unbounded computation over on-chain data.

Our partners are already developing game-changing applications with Steel. One application has shown gas savings of 1.2 billion gas for a contract call using around 400,000 SLOADs. 1.2 billion gas is around 30 blocks worth of execution and this can be verified onchain in one proof, that costs under $10 to generate, and less than 300k gas to verify. Steel unlocks boundless application runtime, without rollups, without centralization, without re-writing your smart contracts, and without writing ZK circuits. The brakes are off.

## Getting Started with Steel

The recommended place is to start is [Steel examples], specifically the [ERC20 Counter] example.

The [create-steel-app] script will allow you to set up the erc20-counter example locally in one command:

```sh
sh <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/risc0/risc0-ethereum/refs/heads/main/crates/steel/docs/create-steel-app/create-steel-app)
```

This example acts as your skeleton project structure for further development. Once the script is finished, you can run through a test workflow with either local proving or Bonsai proving. Further Steel documentation will guide you through the ERC20-counter example as a guide to explain Steel in detail.
