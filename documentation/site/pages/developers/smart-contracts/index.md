# Smart Contracts

Welcome to the smart contracts documentation for Boundless. This section contains detailed documentation for all our smart contracts, including [interfaces](#interfaces), [libraries](#libraries), and [core contracts](#core-contracts).

:::note

Our smart contracts are built using Solidity and are organized into several key components:

- **Interfaces**: Contract interfaces that define the external API
- **Libraries**: Reusable code libraries
- **Core Contracts**: Main contracts that implement the core business logic
