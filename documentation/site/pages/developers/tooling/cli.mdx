# Boundless CLI

:::note[Boundless CLI Source code]
The Boundless CLI source code can be found at [boundless/crates/boundless-cli](https://github.com/boundless-xyz/boundless/tree/main/crates/boundless-cli).
:::

`boundless` is a command-line interface for interacting with the Boundless Market, specifically designed to help requestors and provers with common interactions

## Installation

You'll need to [install Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html), then you can run the following command to install the CLI.

```bash
cargo install --locked --git https://github.com/boundless-xyz/boundless boundless-cli --branch release-1.0 --bin boundless
```

## Overview

Once installed, simply running `boundless` gives a helpful overview:

The CLI has three main modules:

- [Requestor Module](#TODO): Commands for submitting proof requests
- [Prover Module](#TODO): Commands for locking, executing, proving and fulfilling proof requests
- [Rewards Module](#TODO): Commands for staking and delegating $ZKC, claiming staking and mining rewards, seeing recent rewards and more.

### Module Setup

Each module has a respective interactive `setup` command which allows you to store (in plaintext!) variables such as relevant RPC URLs, private keys etc:

```bash
boundless <MODULE> setup
```
