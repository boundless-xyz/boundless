# Why Kailua?

Kailua uses the RISC-Zero zkVM to verifiably run Optimism's Kona and secure rollups with cryptographic proofs enabling faster finality and reduced operational costs.

Kailua's Fault Proving Game is designed to require constant collateral lockups from both proposers and validators (challengers), whereas the Bisection-based fault dispute game backed by Cannon requires a linear number of deposits proportional to the number of proposals/challenges.

The fault proofs are estimated to require on the order of 100 billion cycles to prove in the worst case, which, on Bonsai, would cost on the order of 100 USD and take around an hour to prove. All proving costs are borne by the dishonest party in the protocol, whether that is the proposer or validator.

## Fraud/Validity Proofs

Kailua enables rollup operators to add a new fault proof contract, compatible with Bedrock contracts `v1.4.0` and above, using the `DisputeGameFactory` rollup instance to their deployment that relies on RISC-Zero zkVM proofs to finalize/dismiss output proposals.

`KailuaGame` optimistically allows outputs to be accepted after a timeout if no fraud proof is published against it, or if the output is challenged, waits for a proof to be submitted to decide whether to dismiss the output.
