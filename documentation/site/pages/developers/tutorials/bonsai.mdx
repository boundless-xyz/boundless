# Migrating from Bonsai?

## What happened to Bonsai?

Bonsai is no longer available for individual developers. Boundless is intended to be a replacement for all your proving needs. If you want to read about the differences between Bonsai and Boundless, please continue on this page. Otherwise, if you have a guest program ready and you are eager to get started, you can follow the [Request a Proof](/developers/tutorials/request) tutorial to create your first proof request.

Adopting Boundless means embracing decentralization; while the initial setup is more complex than Bonsai's  configuration, you gain access to verifiable compute through permissionless, sustainable proving protocol that aligns with Web3's core principles.

## Key Differences

While Bonsai offers simplicity through centralization, Boundless provides:

- *No vendor lock-in*: Decentralized protocol with multiple provers
- *Censorship resistance*: No single point of failure
- *Long-term sustainability*: Community-driven protocol evolution
- *Transparent pricing*: Market-driven proof costs


| Aspect | Bonsai | Boundless |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| *Setup* | 2 environment variables (BONSAI_API_URL + BONSAI_API_KEY) | Wallet + Storage Provider  |
| *Proof Format* | STARK/SNARK (Groth16) | Proof aggregated via SetVerifier |
| *Proof Verification* | Via [receipt.verify](https://docs.rs/risc0-zkvm/latest/risc0_zkvm/struct.Receipt.html#method.verify) or [Verifier Contracts](/developers/smart-contracts/verifier-contracts) | [Verifier Contracts](/developers/smart-contracts/verifier-contracts)|
| *Architecture* | Centralized service | Decentralized protocol |
| *Integration* | Drop-in replacement to guest program | New integration required |

## Getting Started

### Setup

Before you get started, you'll need to set up:

- *Wallet*: Configure a developer wallet for on-chain transactions. For dev testing, something as simple as [metamask](https://metamask.io/en-GB) will do; make sure to create a new account for your dev testing to use with testnets. You'll also need some testnet funds before you can submit a request.
- *Storage Provider*: You'll need to set up either IPFS or S3 for provers to be fulfill your requests. We recommend IPFS via the Pinata gateway, see further instructions [here](/developers/tutorials/request#storage-provider).

### Sending your first proof request

Transitioning to Boundless requires:

- Rearchitecting your proof request and retrieval flow
- Managing proof fulfillment asynchronously
- Handling potential proof request failures or delays

The documentation listed below, along with the [Boundless Foundry Template](https://github.com/boundless-xyz/boundless-foundry-template) and the [Boundless Examples](https://github.com/boundless-xyz/boundless/tree/main/examples), will help you get started in no time.

1. *[Quick Start Guide](/developers/quick-start)*: Set up your first Boundless project and request your first proof with our example app, [Boundless Foundry Template](https://github.com/boundless-xyz/boundless-foundry-template).
2. *[Request a Proof](/developers/tutorials/request)*: Go into more specifics when it comes to requesting a proof with request/offer configuration.
3. *[Proof Tracking](/developers/tutorials/tracking)*: Implement monitoring of requests and retrieving proofs when they are finished
4. *[Use a Proof](/developers/tutorials/use)*: Understand how to use a Boundless proof in your app.
5. *[Boundless Tooling](/developers/tooling/sdk)*: Explore the SDK and CLI to configure your request flow to your specific needs.


### Proof Verification

If you are verifying proofs onchain, Boundless proofs verify in exactly the same manner as proofs delivered via Bonsai, and via the same [Verifier Router contract](/developers/smart-contracts/verifier-contracts) you are used to using. There should be no upgrade required, unless you are using an old version of (i.e. 1.X.X) R0VM.
