# Migrating from Bonsai?

This guide helps developers understand the key differences between Bonsai and Boundless, and provides a clear path for adopting Boundless's decentralized proving protocol.

## Key Differences at a Glance

| Aspect | Bonsai | Boundless |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| **Setup** | 2 environment variables | Wallet + configuration |
| **Proof Format** | Groth16 by default | Flexible (requires configuration) |
| **Architecture** | Centralized service | Decentralized protocol |
| **Integration** | Drop-in replacement | New integration required |

## Why Adopt Boundless?

While Bonsai offers simplicity through centralization, Boundless provides:

- **No vendor lock-in**: Decentralized protocol with multiple provers
- **Censorship resistance**: No single point of failure
- **Long-term sustainability**: Community-driven protocol evolution
- **Transparent pricing**: Market-driven proof costs

## Integration Requirements

### From Bonsai's Simple Setup

```bash
export BONSAI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
export BONSAI_API_URL="BONSAI_URL"
RISC0_DEV_MODE=false forge test
```

### To Boundless's Protocol Integration

1. **Wallet Setup**: Configure a developer wallet for on-chain transactions
2. **Smart Contract Integration**: Deploy or interact with proof request contracts
3. **Proof Retrieval**: Implement custom logic for monitoring and retrieving proofs
4. **Error Handling**: Build resilience for decentralized network dynamics

## Getting Started with Boundless

### Essential Resources

1. **[Quick Start Guide](/developers/quick-start)**: Set up your first Boundless project
2. **[Requesting a Proof Tutorial](/developers/tutorials/requesting-a-proof)**: Learn the proof request lifecycle
3. **[Smart Contracts Guide](/developers/smart-contracts/)**: Understand Boundless contract interfaces
4. **[Tooling Overview](/developers/tooling/)**: Explore available developer tools

### Migration Considerations

**This is not a drop-in replacement.** Transitioning to Boundless requires:

- Rearchitecting your proof request and retrieval flow
- Implementing on-chain interactions
- Managing proof fulfillment asynchronously
- Handling potential proof request failures or delays

## Example: Basic Proof Request

Instead of Bonsai's API call, Boundless uses on-chain requests:

```solidity
// Submit a proof request to Boundless
boundlessMarket.requestProof{value: maxPrice}(
    imageId,
    input,
    requirements
);
```

See the [full tutorial](/developers/tutorials/requesting-a-proof) for complete implementation details.

## Support and Next Steps

1. **Start with the [Boundless Foundry Template](https://github.com/boundless-market/boundless-foundry-template)** for a working example
2. **Join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/boundless)** for community support
3. **Review [pricing mechanics](/developers/tutorials/how-does-pricing-work)** to understand costs

## Summary

Adopting Boundless means embracing decentralization over convenience. While the initial setup is more complex than Bonsai's two-line configuration, you gain access to a permissionless, sustainable proving protocol that aligns with blockchain's core principles.
