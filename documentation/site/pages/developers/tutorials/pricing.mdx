# Configuring A Request

Each request specifies a set of request parameters; these parameters determine hwo the auction is executed, and therefore how provers respond to the request. Requestors, who understand these parameters, will be able to more effectively tailor requests to current market conditions. This is essential for getting timely and cost-effective proofs. This guide helps requestors understand, configure and optimize their requests.

## Request Parameters

![Request Parameter Diagram](/request_diagram.png)

| Parameter      | request.yaml name | Units   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|----------------|-------------------|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Ramp Up Start  | `rampUpStart`     | blocks  | An alloted period of time before the auction price begins to increase, allowing provers to analyze jobs before the price increases. Provers can still lock during this period. This is specified in blocks.                              |
| Ramp Up Period | `rampUpPeriod`    | blocks  | The duration of time period where the auction price increases linearly. Concretely, it is the number of blocks it takes for the price to increase from the minimum price (`min_price`) to the maximum price (`max_price`).                                                             |
| Lock Timeout   | `lockTimeout`     | seconds | The maximum time a prover has to submit once the ramp up period has begun. Regardless of when the prover locks, they must submit the job onchain prior to this time, otherwise they will be slashed. |
| Timeout        | `timeout`         | seconds | The total time after which the proof expires. After this time, if no provers have fulfilled the request, the request will stay *unfulfilled*.                                                                          |
| Min Price      | `min_price`       | wei     | The floor price of the auction; this can be set to 0.                                                                                                                                                 |
| Max Price      | `max_price`       | wei     | The ceiling of the auction; the maximum absolute price you are willing to pay.                                                                                                                           |
| Collateral     | `lockCollateral`  | $ZKC     | Provers have to deposit *$ZKC* as [proving collateral](/zkc/collateral). This parameter specifies the exact amount of *$ZKC* a prover will lock as collateral when locking the order. If the prover does not fulfill the request before the primary prover deadline (the lock timeout), this collateral is slashed and 50% of the collateral becomes a bounty for secondary provers to claim upon successful proof fulfillment.                                            |


## Latency Sensitive Parameters [WIP]

Each requestor will have a different latency tolerance; some might be fine with receiving a proof on the scale of hours, whereas others will have more time-critical applications and require proof fulfillment on the scale of minutes. These latency requirements should dictate how requestors set the time-specific request parameters:

| Parameter      | Units   | Recommendation                       | Notes                                                                                                                                 |
|----------------|---------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Ramp Up Start  | blocks  | `(Cycle Count / 25 MHz) + 10`         | Use 10 blocks if you want to more aggressively prioritize latency with the potential of adding more costs in the short to medium term |
| Ramp Up Period | blocks  | NA                                   | Example : With 1Â¢ increments per block, divide  Max Price  by $0.01 to determine period length.                                       |
| Lock Timeout   | seconds | Cycle Count / Expected Effective MHz | Start with 1 MHz assumption. As network stability increases, increase in 5 MHz increments till your requests are at 30 MHz            |
| Timeout        | seconds | NA                                   |                                                                                                                                       |


## Price Sensitive Parameters



## OLD CONTENT ðŸ‘‡

### Pricing

Each request needs to specify how much the requestor is willing to pay to receive a proof.
Each prover on the decentralized market will decide whether that price is acceptable to them, and compete to fulfill those requests.

The offer section of a request specifies the parameters of the [reverse Dutch auction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_auction#Dutch_reverse_auctions), part of the [proof lifecycle](/developers/proof-lifecycle).
This is the mechanism by which the requestor and prover can agree upon a price, and ensures the requestor will get the best price available from any prover on the market.

### Offer Parameters

An offer contains the following:

- Pricing parameters
- Minimum price
- Maximum price
- Ramp-up start (timestamp measured in seconds since the UNIX epoch)
- Length of ramp-up period (measured in seconds since ramp-up start)
- Lock timeout (measured in seconds since ramp-up start)
- Timeout (measured in seconds since ramp-up start)
- Lock collateral (measured in ZKC)

For example, an offer might specify:

- Pricing parameters
  - Minimum price: 0.001 Ether
  - Maximum price: 0.002 Ether
- Ramp-up start: 1000 seconds since the UNIX epoch
- Length of ramp-up period: 50 seconds
- Lock timeout: 100 seconds
- Timeout: 200 seconds
- Lock collateral: 2 ZKC

The pricing parameters are used to determine the reward that gets paid-out when the request is fulfilled (ie, the proof has been verified).

- During the discovery period (the initial phase of the auction before ramp-up start), the price is just the minimum Ether price.
- During the ramp-up period (which immediately follows the discovery period), the price grows linearly up-to the maximum Ether price.
- After the ramp-up period, the price remains at the maximum Ether price until lock timeout.
- After the lock timeout, the price in Ether drops to zero.
- If the request was locked, but not fulfilled, then a portion of the lock collateral is slashed from the prover that locked the request and awarded to anyone that fulfills the request before timeout.

Continuing with the example offer given above, the price is constant (0.001 Ether, its minimum) until ramp-up starts at timestamp 1000;
at timestamp 1010 it jumps to 0.0012 Ether; on 1020 it jumps to 0.0014 Ether; on 1050 it reaches 0.002 Ether (its maximum), and remains at that value until the lock expires.

Provers can lock a request at any time before the lock timeout. When a prover locks-in a request, they are agreeing to be paid the reward offered by this function at the time of their bid. They are also agreeing to be slashed if they do not fulfill the request before the lock timeout.

After the lock expires, the price in Ether drops to 0. If the request was locked but not fulfilled, the prover that locked the request is slashed of their lock collateral. A portion (currently 25%) of the lock collateral is used to price the request. Therefore, the price of the request is 0.5 ZKC until the request expires.
