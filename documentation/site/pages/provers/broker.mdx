# Broker Configuration & Operation

## Overview

The Broker is a service that runs within the [Bento](/provers/proving-stack#what-is-bento) proving stack. It is responsible for market interactions including bidding on jobs, locking them, issuing job requests to the Bento proving cluster, and submitting proof fulfillments onchain.

## Broker Configuration

:::tip[Tip]
Broker will live-reload the `broker.toml` when it changes. In most cases, you will not need to restart the Broker for the configuration to take effect.
:::

Broker configuration is primarily managed through the `broker.toml` file in the Boundless directory. This file is mounted into the Broker container and it is used to configure the Broker daemon.

### Deposit / Balance

The Boundless market requires funds (USDC) deposited as stake before a prover can bid on requests.
Brokers must first deposit some USDC into the market contract to fund their account.
These funds cover staking during lock-in.
It is recommend that a broker keep a balance on the market >= `max_stake` (configured via broker.toml).

#### Deposit Stake to the Market

:::note[Note]
You will need the Boundless CLI installed to deposit/check your balance.
Please see [Installing the Boundless CLI](/developers/tutorials/request#installing-the-boundless-cli) for instructions.
:::

```sh [Terminal]
export RPC_URL=<TARGET_CHAIN_RPC_URL>
export PRIVATE_KEY=<BROKER_PRIVATE_KEY>
source <(just env testnet)

# Example: 'account deposit-stake 100'
boundless-cli account deposit-stake <USDC_TO_DEPOSIT>
```

#### Check Current Stake Balance

```sh [Terminal]
export RPC_URL=<TARGET_CHAIN_RPC_URL>
export PRIVATE_KEY=<BROKER_PRIVATE_KEY>
source <(just env testnet)

boundless-cli account stake-balance [wallet_address]
```

You can omit the `PRIVATE_KEY` environment variable here and specify your `wallet_address` as a optional parameter to the `balance` command, i.e., `account balance 0x000....`

### Settings in Broker.toml

:::warning[Warning]
Quotation marks matter in TOML so please pay particular attention to the quotation marks for config values.
:::

`broker.toml` contains the following settings for the market:

| setting                  | initial value | description                                                                                                    |
| ------------------------ | ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| mcycle\_price            | `".001"`      | The price (in native token of target market) of proving 1M cycles.                                             |
| assumption\_price        | `"0.1"`       | Currently unused.                                                                                              |
| peak\_prove\_khz         | `500`         | This should correspond to the maximum number of cycles per second (in kHz) your proving backend can operate.   |
| min\_deadline            | `150`         | This is a minimum number of blocks before the requested job expiration that Broker will attempt to lock a job. |
| lookback\_blocks         | `100`         | This is used on Broker initialization, and sets the number of blocks to look back for candidate proofs.        |
| max\_stake               | `"0.5"`       | The maximum amount used to lock in a job for any single order.                                                 |
| skip\_preflight\_ids     | `[]`          | A list of `imageID`s that the Broker should skip preflight checks in format `["0xID1","0xID2"]`.               |
| max\_file\_size          | `50_000_000`  | The maximum guest image size in bytes that the Broker will accept.                                             |
| allow\_client\_addresses | `[]`          | When defined, this acts as a firewall to limit proving only to specific client addresses.                           |
| lockin\_priority\_gas    | `100`         | Additional gas to add to the base price when locking in stake on a contract to increase priority.              |

```

### Benchmarking Bento

First, start a bento cluster:

```sh [Terminal]
just bento

# Or with an env file for configuration
just bento .env.broker
```

Load environment variables for the target network:

```sh [Terminal]
# For example, if using an env file
source <(just env broker)
```

Then, run the benchmark:

```sh [Terminal]
boundless-cli proving benchmark --request-ids <IDS>
```

where IDS is a comma-separated list of request IDs from the network or order stream configured.

It is recommended to pick a few requests of varying sizes and programs, biased towards larger proofs for a more representative benchmark.

To run programs manually, and for performance optimizations, see [performance optimizations](/provers/performance-optimization).

### Running the Broker service with bento

Running a broker with `just` will also start the Bento cluster through docker compose.

:::note[Note]
`just` installation instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/casey/just#installation).
:::

```sh [Terminal]
just broker
```

### Make sure Bento is running

:::warning[Warning]
A Broker needs a [Bento](/provers/proving-stack#what-is-bento) instance to operate. Please follow the [quick start](/provers/quick-start) guide to get Bento up and running.
:::

To check Bento is running correctly, you can send a sample proof workload:

> Before running this, [install Bento CLI](/provers/quick-start#bento-cli-installation)

```sh [Terminal]
# In the bento directory
RUST_LOG=info bento_cli -c 32
```

### Running a standalone broker

To run broker with an already initialized Bento cluster or with a different prover, you can build and run a broker directly with the following:

```sh [Terminal]
cargo build --bin broker --release
# Run with flags or environment variables based on network/configuration
./target/release/broker
```

### Stopping The Broker Service

```sh [Terminal]
just broker down
```

## Broker Optimization

### Increasing Lock-in Rate

Once your broker is running, there are a few methods to optimize the lock-in rate. These methods are aimed at making your broker service more competitive in the market through different means:

1. Decreasing the `mcycle_price` would tune your Broker to bid at lower prices for proofs.
2. Increasing `lockin_priority_gas` expedites your market operations by consuming more gas which could help outrun other bidders.

### Tuning Service Settings

The `[prover]` settings in `broker.toml` are used to configure the prover service and significantly impact the operation of the service. The most important configuration variable to monitor and iteratively tune is `txn_timeout`. This is the number of seconds to wait for a transaction to be confirmed before timing out. Therefore, if you see timeouts in your logs, `txn_timeout` can be increased to wait longer for transaction confirmations onchain.

## Debugging

### Orders Stuck in 'Lockin' or `submit_merkle` Confirmation Timeouts

You may notice on the [explorer](https://explorer.beboundless.xyz) that the broker has a high number of orders locked-in, but the fulfillment rate is low or even zero. This could be due to transaction confirmation timeouts. A good place to start would be to increase the `txn_timeout` in the `broker.toml` file iteratively, and see how that affects the broker's fulfillment rate.

If you need a manual way to restart orders that are "stuck", please follow:

::::steps

##### First, you'll need to manually connect to the SQLite database for the broker. This can be done inside the broker container via `sqlite3 /db/broker.db` or by mounting the `broker-data` Docker volume

##### Next, you'll need to find the batch that contains the order:

```sql [Terminal]
SELECT id FROM batches WHERE data->>'orders' LIKE '%"TARGET_ORDER_ID"%';
-- Example: SELECT id FROM batches WHERE data->>'orders' LIKE '%"0x466acfc0f27bba9fbb7a8508f576527e81e83bd00000caa"%';
```

##### Finally, you can trigger a rerun of the submitter task:

```sql [Terminal]
UPDATE batches SET data = json_set(data, '$.status', 'Complete') WHERE id = YOUR_BATCH_ID_FROM_STEP_2;
-- Example: UPDATE batches SET data = json_set(data, '$.status', 'Complete') WHERE id = 1;
```
