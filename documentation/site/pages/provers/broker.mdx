# Broker Configuration & Operation

## Overview

The Broker is a service that runs within the [Bento](/provers/proving-stack#what-is-bento) proving stack. It is responsible for market interactions including bidding on jobs, locking them, issuing job requests to the Bento proving cluster, and submitting proof fulfillments onchain.

## Broker Configuration

:::tip[Tip]
Broker will live-reload the `broker.toml` when it changes. In most cases, you will not need to restart the Broker for the configuration to take effect.
:::

Broker configuration is primarily managed through the `broker.toml` file in the Boundless directory. This file is mounted into the Broker container and it is used to configure the Broker daemon.

### Hitpoints (HP) Tokens

:::note[Note]
To apply for access to HP tokens and become a prover, please fill out this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScr5B3TZfzLKIb0Hk6oqiMMXdRh4cwpTlczi_zGqdwabvbrfw/viewform) with your details.
:::

In the current phase, the Boundless market will only accept hitpoint (HP) tokens as stake for proving lock-ins. Provers stake HP tokens to participate in proof generation, and failure to meet performance standards results in slashing of your provers HP. These HP tokens can only be used within the Boundless market and as such, they are **non-transferrable** and **hold no monetary value**.

Please refer to the [Deployments](/developers/smart-contracts/deployments) page for the correct Boundless market contract address.

### Deposit / Balance

The Boundless market requires staking funds to be deposited to bid on requests.
Brokers must first deposit some HP into the market contract to fund their account.
These funds cover staking during lock-in.
It is recommend that a broker keep a balance on the market >= `max_stake` (configured via broker.toml).

#### Deposit Stake to the Market

:::note[Note]
You will need the Boundless CLI installed to deposit/check your balance.
Please see [Installing the Boundless CLI](/developers/tutorials/request#installing-the-boundless-cli) for instructions.
:::

```sh [Terminal]
export RPC_URL=<TARGET_CHAIN_RPC_URL>
export PRIVATE_KEY=<BROKER_PRIVATE_KEY>
export BOUNDLESS_MARKET_ADDRESS=<BOUNDLESS_MARKET_ADDR>

# Example: 'deposit-stake 100'
boundless-cli deposit-stake <HP_TO_DEPOSIT>
```

#### Check Current Stake Balance

```sh [Terminal]
export RPC_URL=<TARGET_CHAIN_RPC_URL>
export PRIVATE_KEY=<BROKER_PRIVATE_KEY>
export BOUNDLESS_MARKET_ADDRESS=<BOUNDLESS_MARKET_ADDR>

boundless-cli balance-of-stake [wallet_address]
```

You can omit the `PRIVATE_KEY` environment variable here and specify your `wallet_address` as a optional parameter to the `balance` command, i.e., `balance 0x000....`

### Settings in Broker.toml

:::warning[Warning]
Quotation marks matter in TOML so please pay particular attention to the quotation marks for config values.
:::

`broker.toml` contains the following settings for the market:

| setting                  | initial value | description                                                                                                    |
| ------------------------ | ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| mcycle\_price            | `".001"`      | The price (in native token of target market) of proving 1M cycles.                                             |
| assumption\_price        | `"0.1"`       | Currently unused.                                                                                              |
| peak\_prove\_khz         | `500`         | This should correspond to the maximum number of cycles per second (in kHz) your proving backend can operate.   |
| min\_deadline            | `150`         | This is a minimum number of blocks before the requested job expiration that Broker will attempt to lock a job. |
| lookback\_blocks         | `100`         | This is used on Broker initialization, and sets the number of blocks to look back for candidate proofs.        |
| max\_stake               | `"0.5"`       | The maximum amount used to lock in a job for any single order.                                                 |
| skip\_preflight\_ids     | `[]`          | A list of `imageID`s that the Broker should skip preflight checks in format `["0xID1","0xID2"]`.               |
| max\_file\_size          | `50_000_000`  | The maximum guest image size in bytes that the Broker will accept.                                             |
| allow\_client\_addresses | `[]`          | When defined, this acts as a firewall to limit proving only to specific client addresses.                           |
| lockin\_priority\_gas    | `100`         | Additional gas to add to the base price when locking in stake on a contract to increase priority.              |

## Broker Operation

### Make sure Bento is running

:::warning[Warning]
A Broker needs a [Bento](/provers/proving-stack#what-is-bento) instance to operate. Please follow the [quick start](/provers/quick-start) guide to get Bento up and running.
:::

To check Bento is running correctly, you can send a sample proof workload:

```sh [Terminal]
# In the bento directory
RUST_LOG=info cargo run --bin bento_cli -- -c 32
```

```txt [Terminal]
2024-10-23T14:37:37.364844Z  INFO bento_cli: image_id: a0dfc25e54ebde808e4fd8c34b6549bbb91b4928edeea90ceb7d1d8e7e9096c7 | input_id: eccc8f06-488a-426c-ae3d-e5acada9ae22

```

### Running the Broker service

:::warning[Warning]
Before running the Broker, make sure you have connected to a running instance of Bento.
:::

:::note[Note]
`just` installation instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/casey/just#installation).
:::

```sh [Terminal]
just broker
```

### Stopping The Broker Service

```sh [Terminal]
just broker down
```

## Broker Optimization

### Increasing Lock-in Rate

Once your broker is running, there are a few methods to optimize the lock-in rate. These methods are aimed at making your broker service more competitive in the market through different means:

1. Decreasing the `mcycle_price` would tune your Broker to bid at lower prices for proofs.
2. Increasing `lockin_priority_gas` expedites your market operations by consuming more gas which could help outrun other bidders.
3. Adding known a `imageID` to `skip_preflight_ids` would reduce the delay of preflight/execution on a binary. This would allow you to beat other Brokers by submitting bids quicker.

### Tuning Service Settings

The `[prover]` settings in `broker.toml` are used to configure the prover service and significantly impact the operation of the service. The most important configuration variable to monitor and iteratively tune is `txn_timeout`. This is the number of seconds to wait for a transaction to be confirmed before timing out. Therefore, if you see timeouts in your logs, `txn_timeout` can be increased to wait longer for transaction confirmations onchain.


## Debugging

### Orders Stuck in 'Lockin' or `submit_merkle` Confirmation Timeouts

You may notice on the [explorer](https://explorer.beboundless.xyz) that the broker has a high number of orders locked-in, but the fulfillment rate is low or even zero. This could be due to transaction confirmation timeouts. A good place to start would be to increase the `txn_timeout` in the `broker.toml` file iteratively, and see how that affects the broker's fulfillment rate.

If you need a manual way to restart orders that are "stuck", please follow:

::::steps

##### First, you'll need to manually connect to the SQLite database for the broker. This can be done inside the broker container via `sqlite3 /db/broker.db` or by mounting the `broker-data` Docker volume

##### Next, you'll need to find the batch that contains the order:

```sql [Terminal]
SELECT id FROM batches WHERE data->>'orders' LIKE '%"TARGET_ORDER_ID"%';
-- Example: SELECT id FROM batches WHERE data->>'orders' LIKE '%"0x466acfc0f27bba9fbb7a8508f576527e81e83bd00000caa"%';
```

##### Finally, you can trigger a rerun of the submitter task:

```sql [Terminal]
UPDATE batches SET data = json_set(data, '$.status', 'Complete') WHERE id = YOUR_BATCH_ID_FROM_STEP_2;
-- Example: UPDATE batches SET data = json_set(data, '$.status', 'Complete') WHERE id = 1;
```
