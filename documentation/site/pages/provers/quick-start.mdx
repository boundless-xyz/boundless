# Quick Start

:::warning[Warning]
**Incentives for provers are not active for this phase.**
:::

## Clone the Boundless Repo

:::tip[Use Ubuntu 22.04]
We recommend using Ubuntu 22.04 LTS for your proving node.
:::

To get started, first clone the Boundless monorepo on your proving machine, and switch to the [latest release](https://github.com/boundless-xyz/boundless/releases):

```sh
git clone https://github.com/boundless-xyz/boundless
cd boundless
git checkout release-0.9
```

## Install Dependencies

:::tip[Tip]
This stage can be skipped if you already have docker and docker-nvidia installed.
:::

To run a Boundless prover, you'll need the following dependencies:

* [Docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose)
* [Docker Nvidia Support](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/index.html) (*Note: the install process requires enabling NVIDIAâ€™s experimental packages*)

For a quick set up of Boundless dependencies on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (see [Operating System Requirements](/provers/requirements#operating-system)), please run:

```sh
sudo ./scripts/setup.sh
```

## Running a Test Proof

Boundless is comprised of two major components:
1. *Bento* is the local proving infrastructure. Bento will take requests, prove them and return the result
2. The *Broker* interacts with the Boundless market. Broker can submit or request proves from the market.

To get started with a test proof on a new proving machine, you'll need to install the `bento_cli`:

```sh [Terminal]
cargo install --git https://github.com/risc0/risc0 bento-client --bin bento_cli
```
Once installed, you can run bento with:

```sh [Terminal]
just bento
```

This will spin up bento without the broker. You can check the logs at any time with:

```sh [Terminal]
just bento logs
```

To run the test proof:

```sh [Terminal]
RUST_LOG=info bento_cli -c 32
```

If everything works, you should see something like the following:

![Bento CLI Test Proof Success](/test-proof.png)

Before we move on, stop Bento with:

```sh [Terminal]
just bento down
```

## Running the Broker

:::tip[Need technical support?]
For technical support, please join the [Boundless Discord](https://discord.com/invite/boundlessxyz) and claim the prover role from [Guild.xyz](https://guild.xyz/boundless-xyz).
:::

We have checked that bento successfully generated a test proof. We are now ready to run the broker so that we can start proving on Boundless.

### Install the Boundless CLI

Before we start, we'll need to install the *Boundless CLI* (which is separate to the Bento CLI we installed earlier):

```sh [Terminal]
cargo install --locked boundless-cli
```

### Setup Environment Variables

To set the `VERIFIER_ADDRESS`, `SET_VERIFIER_ADDRESS`, `BOUNDLESS_MARKET_ADDRESS` automatically for Ethereum Sepolia, run:

```sh [Terminal]
source <(just env testnet)
```

You'll need to set two more environment variables yourself:

```sh [Terminal]
export PRIVATE_KEY=""
export RPC_URL=""
```

This is your wallet which will represent your prover on the market; make sure it has funds. For the RPC url, we recommend using [Alchemy](https://alchemy.com).

### Deposit Stake

:::note[Note]
* To apply for access to HP tokens and become a prover, please fill out this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScr5B3TZfzLKIb0Hk6oqiMMXdRh4cwpTlczi_zGqdwabvbrfw/viewform) with your details.
* To read more about depositing funds to the market, and to learn about the hitpoints token, please see [Hitpoints (HP) Tokens](/provers/broker#hitpoints-hp-tokens).
:::

With the environment variables set, you can now deposit HP tokens as stake to your account balance:

```sh [Terminal]
boundless-cli account deposit-stake 100
```

### Start Broker


You can now start broker (which runs both bento + broker i.e. the full proving stack!):

```sh [Terminal]
just broker
```

To check the proving logs, you can use:

```sh [Terminal]
just broker logs
```
### Stop Broker

To stop broker, you can run:

```sh [Terminal]
just broker down
```

Or remove all volumes and data from the service:

```sh [Terminal]
just broker clean
```

## Configuration

### Custom Environment

To run broker with a custom environment file:

```sh [Terminal]
just broker up ./.env.broker
just broker down ./.env.broker
```

### Compose.yml

The `compose.yml` file defines all services within Bento. The Boundless repo includes a starter `compose.yml` which you can see [here](https://github.com/boundless-xyz/boundless/blob/main/compose.yml). For Broker configuration options, please see [Broker.toml](/provers/broker#settings-in-brokertoml).

### Multi GPU

In `compose.yml`, you can configure the number of GPU's via adding new `gpu_agent<I>` and changing the `device_ids` to map to specific physical GPUs (if on a single host, multi-GPU config).

### Multi Host

Services can be run on other hosts, as long as the IP addresses for things link PostgreSQL / Redis / MinIO are updated on the remote host. See the `.env.broker-template` HOST configuration options [here](https://github.com/boundless-xyz/boundless/blob/main/.env.broker-template) to adjust them.

### Segment Size

Under the `exec_agent` service you can configure the segment size with the `--segment-po2` flag. Bigger segments are preferable for performance but do impact the proving systems conjectured security bits slightly.

Segment sizes are specified in powers-of-two (po2).
In order to pick the right segment po2 for your GPU VRAM see [the performance optimization page](/provers/performance-optimization#finding-the-maximum-segment_size-for-gpu-vram).

Next, you'll need to tune your Broker's settings, please see [Broker Optimization](/provers/broker#broker-optimization). If you'd like to learn more about the technical design of Bento, please see the [Bento Technical Design Reference](/provers/bento).
