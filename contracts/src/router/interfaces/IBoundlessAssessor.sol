/// @notice An adapter implementing this interface vouches, for each fill in a
///         batch, that the fulfillment satisfies the requestor's
///         `predicate`. The adapter does NOT verify request authenticity —
///         that is the market's job (binding check before dispatch).
///
///         One adapter ships in v1: `R0BoundlessAssessorAdapter` — verifies
///         an off-chain merkle commitment proof produced by the R0 assessor
///         guest. Fixed ~280k Groth16 verify per call, amortized across all
///         fills in the batch.
///
///         Brokers select an adapter by setting the first 4 bytes of
///         `assessorSeal` to the registered adapter's selector. The router
///         dispatches accordingly; the market is unchanged.
///
/// @dev    Trust contract:
///         - Caller (market) has already verified each `SlimRequest`
///           reconstructs to the lock's stored `requestDigest`. Adapter MUST
///           trust the supplied `requests` as the signed request payload.
///         - `prover` is a universal arg: the market needs a trusted prover
///           for crediting / slashing; the adapter binds it via its own
