# `contracts/src/legacy/` — frozen audited tree

This subtree is a frozen copy of `BoundlessMarket` and its transitive
dependencies as deployed on Base mainnet. It exists so the new market can
forward its pre-router legacy ABI to the audited bytecode at the existing
implementation address via a `fallback() + delegatecall` shim, without
re-introducing the legacy bodies into the new market's bytecode.

## Provenance

The sources here mirror **`main` at commit
[`507f7469`](https://github.com/boundless-xyz/boundless/commit/507f7469)**
(`BM-2598: add depositCollateralTo and depositCollateralWithPermitTo`,
2026-03-13) — the last commit on `main` that touched any of the files in
this tree. The only diffs from that commit are the file-basename + import
renames documented in the table below; the contract bodies are identical.

To verify provenance for any file in this tree:

```bash
diff <(git show 507f7469:contracts/src/<original-path>) \
     contracts/src/legacy/<renamed-path>
```

(For types/libraries that don't reference the renamed interfaces, the
diff should be empty.)

The on-chain identity that ultimately matters is the deployed bytecode at
the BoundlessMarket proxy's pre-upgrade implementation address. On Base
mainnet that is `0x22bb6bbe5d221ef3e738029dab4d1d27ec725cd3`. The
bytecode-parity invariant under `contracts/test/legacy/deployed-bytecode.hex`
+ `deployed-bytecode.meta.toml` is the load-bearing check, regardless of
which git commit the source provenance points at.

## What's in here

| Path | Role |
|---|---|
| `BoundlessMarketLegacy.sol` | Frozen copy of `main`'s `BoundlessMarket`. Renamed file basename only; the contract symbol stays `BoundlessMarket` so deployedBytecode matches the audited deployment byte-for-byte. |
| `IBoundlessMarketLegacy.sol` | Frozen `IBoundlessMarket` interface (defines the legacy `Fulfillment[] + AssessorReceipt` shape, `imageInfo`, `verifyDelivery`, etc.). |
| `IBoundlessMarketCallbackLegacy.sol` | Frozen callback interface. |
| `libraries/{BoundlessMarketLib,MerkleProofish}.sol` | Frozen library deps. |
| `types/*.sol` | Frozen type tree (`Account`, `RequestLock`, `Fulfillment` with `id`+`requestDigest`, `AssessorReceipt`, etc.) the legacy contract was deployed against. |

File basenames are suffixed with `Legacy` so that forge writes artifacts to
distinct `out/` directories from the equivalents in `src/`. **Contract and
interface symbols are deliberately unchanged**: that preserves the
`bytecode_hash = none` build's byte-identical match against the deployed
audited code.

## Freeze policy

**Do not modify any file in this tree.**

The CI job `legacy-bytecode-parity` (in `.github/workflows/contracts.yml`)
runs `contracts/scripts/verify-legacy-bytecode.py`, which fails any PR whose
`legacy/` source no longer compiles to a byte-identical match of
`contracts/test/legacy/deployed-bytecode.hex` (the snapshot of the deployed
OLD impl) after masking the constructor-immutable byte positions. The
expected immutable values themselves are also re-checked against
`contracts/test/legacy/deployed-bytecode.meta.toml`.

## Storage layout interop

The `legacy-bytecode-parity` job also runs
`contracts/scripts/verify-storage-layout.py`, which asserts that every
storage slot reachable from both `src/BoundlessMarket` and
`src/legacy/BoundlessMarketLegacy` has the same layout (label, slot,
offset, normalized type, plus identical struct member layouts for `Account`
and `RequestLock`). If you're adding or modifying a struct in
`src/types/`, that script will catch any divergence from the legacy view
before it can corrupt delegate-call interop.
