# Contract Operations Guide

An operations guide for the Boundless contracts.

> [!NOTE]
> All the commands in this guide assume your current working directory is the root of the repo.

## Dependencies

Requires [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation).

> [!NOTE]
> Running the `manage` commands will run in simulation mode (i.e. will not send transactions) unless the `--broadcast` flag is passed.

Commands in this guide use `yq` to parse the TOML config files.

You can install `yq` by following the [direction on GitHub][yq-install], or using `go install`.

```bash
go install github.com/mikefarah/yq/v4@latest
```

## Configuration

Configurations and deployment state information is stored in `deployment.toml`.
It contains information about each chain (e.g. name, ID, Etherscan URL), and addresses for the RISC Zero verifier router contracts on each chain.

Accompanying the `deployment.toml` file is a `deployment_secrets.toml` file with the following schema.
It is used to store somewhat sensative API keys for RPC services and Etherscan.
Note that it does not contain private keys or API keys for Fireblocks.
It should never be committed to `git`, and the API keys should be rotated if this occurs.

```toml
[chains.$CHAIN_KEY]
rpc-url = "..."
etherscan-api-key = "..."
```

## Environment

### Anvil

In development and to test the operations process, you can use Anvil.

Start Anvil:

```bash
anvil -a 10 --block-time 1 --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8545
```

Set your RPC URL, as well as your public and private key:

```bash
export RPC_URL="http://localhost:8545"
export DEPLOYER_PUBLIC_KEY="0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266"
export DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY="0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80"
```

### Public Networks (Testnet or Mainnet)

Set the chain you are operating on by the key from the `deployment.toml` file.
An example chain key is "ethereum-sepolia", and you can look at `deployment.toml` for the full list.

> TODO: Instead of reading these into environment variables, we can have the Forge script directly read them from the TOML file.

```zsh
export CHAIN_KEY="xxx-testnet"
```

Set your RPC URL, public and private key.

```bash
export RPC_URL=$(yq eval -e ".chains[\"${CHAIN_KEY:?}\"].rpc-url" contracts/deployment_secrets.toml | tee /dev/stderr)
export ADMIN_PUBLIC_KEY=$(yq eval -e ".chains[\"${CHAIN_KEY:?}\"].admin" contracts/deployment.toml | tee /dev/stderr)
```

> [!TIP]
> Foundry has a [config full of information about each chain][alloy-chains], mapped from chain ID.

Example RPC URLs:

- `https://eth-sepolia.g.alchemy.com/v2/YOUR_API_KEY`
- `https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/YOUR_API_KEY`

### Fireblocks

Requires the [Fireblocks integration for Foundry](https://developers.fireblocks.com/docs/ethereum-smart-contract-development#using-foundry).

Also requires that you have a [Fireblocks API account](https://developers.fireblocks.com/docs/quickstart).

Set your public key, your Etherscan API key, and the necessary parameters for Fireblocks:

> [!NOTE]
> Fireblocks only supports RSA for API request signing.
> `FIREBLOCKS_API_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH` can be the key itself, rather than a path.

> [!NOTE]
> When this guide says "public key", it's equivalent to "address".

```bash
export FIREBLOCKS_API_KEY="..."
export FIREBLOCKS_API_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH="..."

# IF YOU ARE IN A SANDBOX ENVIRONMENT, be sure to also set this:
export FIREBLOCKS_API_BASE_URL="https://sandbox-api.fireblocks.io"
```

Then, in the instructions below, pass the `--fireblocks` (`-f`) flag to the `manage` script.

> [!NOTE]
> Your Fireblocks API user will need to have "Editor" permissions (i.e., ability to propose transactions for signing, but not necessarily the ability to sign transactions). You will also need a Transaction Authorization Policy (TAP) that specifies who the signers are for transactions initiated by your API user, and this policy will need to permit contract creation as well as contract calls.

> [!NOTE]
> Before you approve any contract-call transactions, be sure you understand what the call does! When in doubt, use [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/) to lookup the function selector, together with a [calldata decoder](https://openchain.xyz/tools/abi) ([alternative](https://calldata.swiss-knife.xyz/decoder)) to decode the call's arguments.

> [!TIP]
> Foundry and the Fireblocks JSON RPC shim don't quite get along.
> In order to avoid sending the same transaction for approval twice (or more), use ctrl-c to
> kill the forge script once you see that the transaction is pending approval in the Fireblocks
> console.

## Deploy a set verifier with emergency stop mechanism

This is a two-step process, guarded by the `TimelockController`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Currently only the deployment of the set verifier with emergency stop mechanism can be executed from this repo.
> Adding the new set verifier to the `RiscZeroVerifierRouter` must, instead, be done via the `risc0-ethereum` repo.

### Deploy the set verifier

1. Make available for download the `set-builder` elf and set its image ID and url in the `deployment.toml` file.

   To generate a deterministic image ID run:

   ```zsh
   RISC0_USE_DOCKER=true cargo build
   ```

   > [!NOTE]
   > This will populate the image ID in the `contracts/src/SetBuilderImageID.sol`.
   > You can then upload the file located in `target/riscv-guest/riscv32im-risc0-zkvm-elf/docker/aggregation_set_guest/aggregation-set-guest`
   > to some HTTP server and get back a download URL.
   > Finally copy over these values in the `deployment.toml` file.

2. Dry run deployment of the set verifier and estop:

   ```zsh
   VERIFIER_ESTOP_OWNER=${ADMIN_PUBLIC_KEY:?} \
   bash contracts/scripts/manage DeployEstopSetVerifier
   ```

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > Check the logs from this dry run to verify the estop owner is the expected address.
   > It should be equal to the RISC Zero admin address on the given chain.
   > Note that it should not be the `TimelockController`.
   > Also check the chain ID to ensure you are deploying to the chain you expect.
   > And check the selector to make sure it matches what you expect.

3. Send deployment transactions for the set verifier by running the command again with `--broadcast`.

   > [!NOTE]
   > When using Fireblocks, sending a transaction to a particular address may require allow-listing it.

4. Replace the `set-verifier` field of the `deployment.toml` file with the newly deployed set verifier address.

5. Add the addresses for the newly deployed contract to the `deployment.toml` file of the `risc0-ethereum` repo.

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > This step must be executed from the `risc0-ethereum` repo.

   It should look like:

   ```toml
   [[chains.anvil.verifiers]]
   version = "0.3.0"
   selector = "0x03ca0a3e"
   verifier = "0x0165878a594ca255338adfa4d48449f69242eb8f"
   estop = "0xa513e6e4b8f2a923d98304ec87f64353c4d5c853"
   ```

6. Set the verifier selector and estop address for the verifier:

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > This step must be executed from the `risc0-ethereum` repo.

   > TIP: One place to find this information is from the output of the previous step.

   ```zsh
   export VERIFIER_SELECTOR="0x..."
   export VERIFIER_ESTOP=$(yq eval -e ".chains[\"${CHAIN_KEY:?}\"].verifiers[] | select(.selector == \"${VERIFIER_SELECTOR:?}\") | .estop" contracts/deployment.toml | tee /dev/stderr)
   ```

7. Dry run the operation to schedule the operation to add the verifier to the router.

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > This step must be executed from the `risc0-ethereum` repo.

   Fill in the addresses for the relevant chain below.
   `ADMIN_PUBLIC_KEY` should be set to the Fireblocks admin address.

   ```zsh
   bash contracts/script/manage ScheduleAddVerifier
   ```

8. Send the transaction for the scheduled update by running the command again with `--broadcast`.

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > This step must be executed from the `risc0-ethereum` repo.

   This will send one transaction from the admin address.

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > If the admin address is in Fireblocks, this will prompt the admins for approval.

9. Finish the update.

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > This step must be executed from the `risc0-ethereum` repo.

   Follow the deployment instructions detailed in the [finish-the-update] section.

## Deploy and upgrade the proof market with the **UUPS** proxy pattern

The Boundless market is deployed and upgraded using the **UUPS (Universal Upgradeable Proxy Standard)** proxy pattern.

### Deploy the proof market

1. Make available for download the `asessor` elf and set its image ID and url in the `deployment.toml` file.

   To generate a deterministic image ID run:

   ```zsh
   RISC0_USE_DOCKER=true cargo build
   ```

   > [!NOTE]
   > This will populate the image ID in the `contracts/src/AssessorImageID.sol`.
   > You can then upload the file located in `target/riscv-guest/riscv32im-risc0-zkvm-elf/docker/asessor_guest/assessor-guest`
   > to some HTTP server and get back a download URL.
   > Finally copy over these values in the `deployment.toml` file.

   > [!TIP]
   > The `r0vm` binary can be used to double-check that the imageID corresponds to a given elf. e.g., `r0vm --id --elf [elf_path]`

2. Dry run deployment of the proof market and proxy:

   ```zsh
   PROOF_MARKET_OWNER=${ADMIN_PUBLIC_KEY:?} \
   bash contracts/scripts/manage DeployProofMarket
   ```

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > Check the logs from this dry run to verify the proof market owner is the expected address.
   > It should be equal to the RISC Zero admin address on the given chain.
   > Note that it should not be the `TimelockController`.
   > Also check the chain ID to ensure you are deploying to the chain you expect.
   > And check the Assessor info to make sure they match what you expect.

   > [!TIP]
   > The `r0vm` binary can be used to double-check that the imageID corresponds to a given elf. e.g., `r0vm --id --elf [elf_path]`

3. Send deployment transactions for the proof market by running the command again with `--broadcast`.

   > [!NOTE]
   > When using Fireblocks, sending a transaction to a particular address may require allow-listing it.

4. Add the ProofMarket (proxy) address of the newly deployed contract to the `deployment.toml` file.

   Load the deployed ProofMarket (proxy) address into the environment:

   ```zsh
   export PROOF_MARKET=$(yq eval -e ".chains[\"${CHAIN_KEY:?}\"].proof-market" contracts/deployment.toml | tee /dev/stderr)
   ```

5. Test the deployment.

   ```bash
   cast call --rpc-url ${RPC_URL:?} \
       ${PROOF_MARKET:?} \
       'imageInfo()(bytes32,string)'
   ```

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > Make sure the Assessor info to make sure they match what you expect.

### Upgrade the proof market

1. If changed, upload the new `assessor` elf and update its imageID and url in the `deployment.toml` file (optional)

2. Dry run the upgrade of the proof market and proxy:

   ```zsh
   PROOF_MARKET_OWNER=${ADMIN_PUBLIC_KEY:?} \
   bash contracts/scripts/manage UpgradeProofMarket
   ```

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > Check the logs from this dry run to verify the proof market owner is the expected address.
   > It should be equal to the RISC Zero admin address on the given chain.
   > Note that it should not be the `TimelockController`.
   > Also check the chain ID to ensure you are deploying to the chain you expect.
   > And check the Assessor info to make sure they match what you expect.

3. Send the upgrade transactions for the proof market by running the command again with `--broadcast`.

   > [!NOTE]
   > When using Fireblocks, sending a transaction to a particular address may require allow-listing it.

4. Load the upgraded ProofMarket (proxy) address into the environment:

   ```zsh
   export PROOF_MARKET=$(yq eval -e ".chains[\"${CHAIN_KEY:?}\"].proof-market" contracts/deployment.toml | tee /dev/stderr)
   ```

5. Test the deployment.

   ```bash
   cast call --rpc-url ${RPC_URL:?} \
       ${PROOF_MARKET:?} \
       'imageInfo()(bytes32,string)'
   ```

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > Make sure the Assessor info to make sure they match what you expect.
