# Bootstrap

The stack is used to bootstrap a service account with resources that are needed for deployments. 

This stack should only be needed to be deployed once, when a new service account is created. 

Must be deployed as an admin user in each service account.

Currently this just creates a deployment role that is assumed by the ops account in order to deploy Boundless services cross-account.

Each service account has its own stack, since stacks are coupled to AWS accounts.

To update staging:

```
pulumi login
pulumi stack select services-staging
pulumi up
```
