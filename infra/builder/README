# Builder

The builder is an EC2 instance with Docker installed for running remote Docker builds. This is useful during development on M1 Macs when we need to build images that target `amd64`, since the M1 emulation is slow and often fails.

It is only deployed to the dev account, so there is only one stack: `Pulumi.dev.yaml`. Unlike other "dev" stacks, this one uses a shared S3 state bucket and secret provider, since we share a single instance amongst the team.

## Using the builder
1. Get the SSH key from the team vault under "Boundless Builder SSH"
2. Add the key to your ssh agent: `ssh-add ~/id_ed25519_dev_docker_builder`
3. Get the ec2 instance dns name:
  ```
  aws ec2 describe-instances \
    --filters "Name=tag:Name,Values=builder" "Name=instance-state-name,Values=running" \
    --query 'Reservations[*].Instances[*].[PublicDnsName]'
  ```
4. Confirm you can ssh in: `ssh ec2-user@<INSTANCE DNS>`
5. Register the builder in docker, filling in the instance name: `docker buildx create --name aws-builder --driver docker-container --platform linux/amd64 ssh://ec2-user@<INSTANCE DNS>`
6. Set env variable: `export DOCKER_REMOTE_BUILDER="aws-builder"` Our Pulumi stacks are configured to read this variable.
7. Now when you run `pulumi up` the docker builds will run remotely.

## Development

As developer admin:
```
pulumi login "s3://boundless-builder-state20250415161708046300000001?region=us-west-2&awssdk=v2"
pulumi up
```
